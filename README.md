# SVM on Insurance Cost Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict insurance costs using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project includes steps like data cleaning, feature engineering, and model implementation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named `insurance.csv`. It contains various features such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region, which are used to predict the insurance cost.

## Key Steps
1. **Loading Necessary Libraries**: 
   - The project utilizes libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The dataset is loaded using pandas and initial exploration is performed.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - This step includes checking for missing values and getting a statistical summary of the data.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - New features are created or transformed to enhance model accuracy. For example, the categorical feature 'sex' is converted into a binary variable.

5. **Model Implementation**:
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for predicting insurance costs based on the engineered features.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SVM-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd SVM-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "SVM on Insurance cost Prediction.ipynb"
    ```

## Requirements
